% The first line of an input file starting with %& 
% is a special directive used in the TeX typesetting system. 
% This line is called the format line, and it is used to 
% specify a precompiled format file that TeX should use 
% for the document.
% A format is a binary file that TeX can load into memory 
% to process a document faster. It contains the memory dump of a 
% TeX engine after it has processed a set of macro definitions. 
% By using a format, TeX can skip the time-consuming step of 
% reading and processing macro definitions every time it 
% processes a document.
% The %& directive tells TeX to use the specified format 
% instead of the default one. For example, if the first 
% line of your document is %&latex, then TeX will use the 
% latex.fmt format file.

% - Comment lines TEX begin with a % . Any input past a % is ignored.

% Common constructs

% Creating a title page
% - \title{Title text}
% - \author{Author names and addresses}
% - the command \maketitle will create the page using the information provided

% Creating logical sections of text: 
% - \part 
% - \chapter 
% - \section 
% - \subsection 
% - \subsubsection
% - \paragraph 
% - \tableofcontents 
% - \listoffigures 
% - \listoftables 

% Mathematics
% - In-line: $y = 3x^2 + 4x + 2$ ($ puts TeX in math mode; second $ exits math mode)
% - Displayed: use \begin{equation} ... \end{equation}
% - Remember to use $a$ (inline) for variable $a$ (e.g.)
% - Common function names are not set in italics, so in math mode use, e.g.: \sin \cos \exp

% Tables
% - For math, use eqnarray env
% - For text, use tabular env
% - Basic syntax
% - \begin{env}{lcr} % env = "eqnarray" or "tabular"
%   a & b & c \\
%   d & e & f
%   \end{env}
% - % where l ==> left, c ==> center, r ==> right, and the number of
% - % these in the argument is the number of columns 
% Captions: \caption{text} (in figure or table env) 

% Cross-referencing: \label{tag} associates a counter with tag
% - In equation environment, counter is equation counter
% - In figure caption, figure counter
% - In table caption, table counter
% - In running text, section counter
% - \ref{tag} references the counter associated with tag
% - Convention: tag $\to$ tag_type:tag_name (e.g.: sec:intro) (usual types: eq sec tbl fig)

%
% What do \makeatletter and \makeatother do?
%
% All characters in TeX are assigned a Category Code or 
% "catcode". There are 16 catcodes in all, some containing 
% just a single character, e.g. \ is (normally) catcode 0, 
% {, catcode 1 etc. Normal characters are catcode 11; 
% this category normally comprises all of the letter characters. 
% The @ symbol is given the catcode of 12, which means it is 
% not treated as a normal letter. The effects of this are that 
% @ cannot normally be used in user document files as part 
% of a multicharacter macro name. (All other non-letter 
% characters are also forbidden in macro names: for example, 
% \foo123, and \foo?! are not valid macro names.)
%
% In LaTeX class and package files, however, @ 
% is treated as a normal letter (catcode 11) and 
% this allows package writers to make macro-names with 
% @. The advantage of this is that such macro names are 
% automatically protected from regular users: since they 
% cannot use @ as a normal letter, there is no accidental 
% way for a user to override or change a macro that is 
% part of the internal workings of a package.
%
% However, it is sometimes necessary in user documents 
% to have access to such package-internal macros, 
% and so the commands \makeatletter and \makeatother 
% change the catcode of @ from 12 to 11 and 11 to 12, 
% respectively.

One-line code formatting also works with \texttt{minted}. For example, a small fragment of HTML like this:
\mint{html}|<h2>Something <b>here</b></h2>|
\noindent can be formatted correctly.

\begin{verbatim}
// Verbatim is better for textual output, rather than code.
// Hello, world!
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }
